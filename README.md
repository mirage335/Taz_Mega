Large-scale advanced multi-tool desktop factory derived from LulzBot Taz. Successor to FlexReplicator.

Intended to simultaneously operate multiple at least milling, laser, extrusion (FDM 3D Printing), and inkjet (powder 3D printing, 2D coloring) tools.

Total cost is estimated at $1,574.45. Normal Taz bulk production costs using this setup would be closer to $1k/unit, probable savings as follows.

Custom Plates - $200/unit.
Y-axis deduplication - $200/unit.
X/Y axis length reduction - $150/unit

#Tweaks
Z-Axis motor mounting plate edges protrude into the frame extrusions, and must be ground slightly to compensate.

Spacer blocks may not leave adequate clearance for the most ideal gantry plate screw locations. Solvable with moderate grinding.

Lock nuts used in wheel assemblies may conflict with some metal plates. Moderate grinding, or use of jam nuts with threadlocker, are solutions.

Y-Axis threaded rod may not be matched to adequately tight tolerances (<<0.3%). Tightly spring-loading all couplings to one of the two threaded rods may alleviate binding at minimal loss of performance. For light-duty work, only one threaded rod is actually necessary.

Do not overtighten joints between gantry plates and aluminum extrusions, as this can significantly overload of the wheel assemblies.

Many more metric screws and Tee Nuts may be required. In particular, some low-profile M5x12mm screws are required to join the Y-axis assembly to the frame. These can be made by grinding down M5x15mm screws from Open Builds.

Right angle brackets from Open Builds may not be suitable for joining the Z-axis extrusions to the frame. Corner cubes are more than adequate.

#Electronics
Duet electronics with PatchRap panel STRONGLY recommended. Heatsinkng the motor drivers would also be wise, as maximum rated current should be used.
