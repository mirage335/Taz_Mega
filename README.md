Large-scale advanced multi-tool desktop factory derived from LulzBot Taz. Successor to FlexReplicator.

Intended to simultaneously operate multiple at least milling, laser, extrusion (FDM 3D Printing), and inkjet (powder 3D printing, 2D coloring) tools.

#Tweaks
Z-Axis motor mounting plate edges protrude into the frame extrusions, and must be ground slightly to compensate.
Spacer blocks may not leave adequate clearance for the most ideal screw locations. Solvable with moderate grinding.
